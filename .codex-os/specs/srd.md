# Snake Game PRD - Three.js Implementation

## Overview
A browser-based 3D Snake game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. The game features classic Snake mechanics with a modern 3D visual presentation.

## Core Objectives
- Create an engaging 3D version of the classic Snake game
- Demonstrate Three.js capabilities in a simple, playable format
- Provide smooth, responsive gameplay in web browsers

## Core Features

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Snake Movement**: Continuous forward movement with directional controls
- **Food Collection**: Snake grows when consuming food items
- **Collision Detection**: Game ends when snake hits walls or itself
- **Score System**: Points awarded for each food item collected

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Change snake direction (up, down, left, right)
- **Space Bar**: Pause/unpause game
- **R Key**: Restart game after game over

### Visual Elements
- **3D Playing Field**: Bordered rectangular arena with visible walls
- **Snake Body**: Connected 3D cubes/spheres forming the snake
- **Food Items**: Distinct 3D objects (different color/shape from snake)
- **Lighting**: Basic ambient and directional lighting for depth perception

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Game container and UI elements
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering and scene management
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and controls

### Performance Targets
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS on modern browsers
- **Load Time**: Under 3 seconds initial load
- **Memory**: Reasonable memory usage (< 100MB)

### Browser Support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)
- WebGL support required

## User Experience

### Game Flow
1. **Start Screen**: Simple title with "Press Space to Start"
2. **Gameplay**: Immediate snake movement upon start
3. **Game Over**: Display final score with restart option
4. **No Menu System**: Keep it simple with direct gameplay

### Visual Design
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean, simple 3D shapes
- **Color Scheme**: High contrast colors for visibility
- **Camera Angle**: Fixed isometric or top-down view
- **No UI Clutter**: Score display only

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Snake moves smoothly in 3D space
- ✅ Collision detection works accurately
- ✅ Score tracking functions correctly
- ✅ Game restarts properly
- ✅ Controls respond without delay

### Quality Standards
- No gameplay bugs or glitches
- Consistent performance across target browsers
- Intuitive controls requiring no explanation
- Visual clarity in all game elements

## Out of Scope (V1)
- Sound effects or music
- Multiple difficulty levels
- High score persistence
- Mobile touch controls
- Multiplayer functionality
- Power-ups or special items
- Animated transitions or effects

## Implementation Notes
- Keep Three.js scene simple with basic geometries
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Implement simple grid-based movement system
- Focus on core gameplay over visual effects
- Single HTML file preferred for simplicity

## Timeline Estimate
**Total Development Time**: 1-2 days for experienced developer

- Setup and basic Three.js scene: 2-3 hours
- Snake movement and controls: 3-4 hours  
- Collision detection and game logic: 2-3 hours
- Food generation and score system: 1-2 hours
- Polish and testing: 1-2 hours
